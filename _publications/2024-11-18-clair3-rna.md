excerpt: 'Clair3-RNA is a deep learning-based variant caller designed for small variant detection in long-read RNA-seq data. It improves both accuracy and speed by combining signal-level features, splicing-aware alignment, and attention-based neural network architectures. This tool enables high-throughput variant discovery from transcriptomic data in research and clinical applications.'
