<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! -->

Research Interest
======
During my undergraduate studies, I focused on research at the intersection of bioinformatics and AI for science, particularly the interdisciplinary integration of artificial intelligence with biology and pharmacology. Specifically, I explored protein methylation and RNA expression and regulation using deep learning techniques. Looking ahead, my Ph.D. research will center on multimodal learning and computer vision, under the supervision of Yangtze River Scholar Prof. [Xu Yong](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xuyong).

<!-- Research Experience
======
During my undergraduate studies at Jilin University, I received professional training in scientific research. As the team leader in the University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, I led my team to complete a project titled “Main Document Extraction and Document Attribute Classification Methods Based on Deep Learning.” This project focuses on techniques for classifying articles based on their main content. Using comprehensive layout analysis methods, the document is divided into smaller regions. We apply the Faster R-CNN algorithm to extract and classify features from each region, then integrate the features of multiple regions within the document to form the document’s overall features, achieving the goals of classification and main content extraction.

My undergraduate thesis was titled “Prediction of Protein Methylation Sites Based on a Dense Convolutional Framework.” This project was completed under the funding of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 62272192), which was approved by my supervisor. The quality of the thesis was high, and I was awarded the 2024 Excellent Undergraduate Thesis Award by Jilin University. A scientific paper based on this project has been accepted for inclusion in the IEEE 2024 Bioinformatics and Biomedical International Conference (CCF-B) workshop. -->

<p align="center" style="font-size:17px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; line-height:1.7;">
  Outside the world of algorithms and biology, I find energy and balance through <strong style="color:#2e86de;">travel</strong> and <strong style="color:#28b463;">competitive badminton</strong>.
  <br><br>
  🏆 I am proudly to be selected as Athletes' representatives taking the oath in the <strong>Chinese National University Badminton Championship</strong>.Our team togerther won the <strong>Men’s Team Gold Medal</strong> at the <strong>Jilin Province Student Games</strong>, and triumphed at the <strong>CSSA Hong Kong Badminton Championship</strong>.
  <br><br>
  ✈️ Traveling allows me to explore new cultures, capture breathtaking views, and reflect deeply — a creative fuel for both life and research.

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

<!-- **Markdown generator** -->

<!-- The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
